Running Gradle task 'assembleDebug'...                          
Your project is configured with Android NDK 25.1.8937393, but the following plugin(s) depend on a different Android NDK version:
- app_links requires Android NDK 27.0.12077973
- google_mobile_ads requires Android NDK 27.0.12077973
- path_provider_android requires Android NDK 27.0.12077973
- share_plus requires Android NDK 27.0.12077973
- shared_preferences_android requires Android NDK 27.0.12077973
- url_launcher_android requires Android NDK 27.0.12077973
- webview_flutter_android requires Android NDK 27.0.12077973
Fix this issue by using the highest Android NDK version (they are backward compatible).
Add the following to /Users/anmijung/Desktop/TalkBingo/app/android/app/build.gradle.kts:

    android {
        ndkVersion = "27.0.12077973"
